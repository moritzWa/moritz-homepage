In this Article I will be analyzing and comparing the very few examples for open source platform that exist like [spectrum.chat](https://slack-redir.net/link?url=https%3A%2F%2Fspectrum.chat%2F). I will also examine the application of smart contracts to engineer a Decentralized autonomous organizations (DAOs) where the costs of running the infastructure of a service are distributed algorithmically.

## The structure will look something like this:

1. Definition of platforms and marketplaces
2. Definition of open source platforms/marketplaces i.e. open platforms
3. Open source and proprietary Licensing
4. Decentralized autonomous organizations (DAOs)
5. Main factors that contribute to the growth of a platform
6. Obstacles of open platforms
7. Funding for open platforms through smart contracts
