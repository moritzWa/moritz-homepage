In the last few years, I learned a lot about learning because I generally strive to be as effective and productive at what I do. However, I noticed that in Software engineering, which is a unique profession in many regards, there is only a little advice on this topic. Searching the internet has brought up some resources like the book [Pragmatic Thinking and Learning by Andy Hunt](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/3063393-pragmatic-thinking-and-learning).

But there are only little Youtube videos on this topic. Therfore I recorded this short video with the title:Â [The Learning Psychology of Software Engineering](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tG8vUZ4fQac).

<!-- ```js
console.log("Hello World")
```

## Default NodeJS server

```js
const http = require("http")

const hostname = "127.0.0.1"
const port = 3000

const server = http.createServer((req, res) => {
  res.statusCode = 200
  res.setHeader("Content-Type", "text/plain")
  res.end("Hello World\n")
})

server.listen(port, hostname, () => {
  console.log(`Server running at http://${hostname}:${port}/`)
})
``` -->
