## 1 Introduction

In the years 2003 to 2018 the number of Kids reading for personal interest in the US fell from 0.17 hours to 0.12[^1] per day. A related development in the distribution of free time can be seen in that of kids playing video games. A new study out of Germany shows that every twelfth teenager is addicted to video games[^2].

With those developments continuing we encounter the danger of a more and more illiterate and manipulated society.

In this essay, I will look into this problem and a potential solution. But more precisely I will ask:  “Should the state provide education about psychology to reduce game addiction rates?”

I will argue that the right way to protect the citizen and children is to educate them about human psychology.

## 2 The Dilemma

### 2.2 Algorithms in Game design

In this part I will point out the three forces that from my reasoning could combine and harm our society and youth.

#### 2.2.1 Psychology and Biology

The discipline of psychology is a relatively young one. With psychologists like Daniel Kahneman discovering some of our most life forming biases and behaviors just a few decades ago. In comparison, the first rules for geometric constructions appeared as early as the 3rd century BC[^3].

Psychology at its roots consists of biochemical mechanisms. And,

“[t]he better we understand the biochemical mechanisms that underpin human emotions, desires and choices, the better computers can become in analyzing human behavior, predicting human decisions, ...”[^4], describes how those new scientific findings will change how we as consumers are manipulated.

#### 2.2.2 Game design

Secondly, the rather young field of Game design is taking advantage of all those new findings and furthering a more psychologically optimized and growing gaming industry. One only needs to look at the references of the Wikipedia article on Game design and the one Video Game Design with about 80% of the former and 100% of the latter references out of a combined number of 94 references out of this century.

An example of a technique used comes from one of the leading thinkers of Gamification (an adjacent field). Yu-Kai Chou describes the technique of _torture breaks_ in his book. This technique is part of his framework called the _Eight Core Drives [^5] and part of tie Core Drive_ of Scarcity and Impatience_where the players’ impatience and susceptibility to scarcity in utilized to make him come back to the game. For example when you have to wait several hours to play another round of candy crush, a popular mobile game. The name alone, of those techniques that manipulate around nine million people per day for three hours with one of these games[^6], suggests harm or torture to the user.

#### 2.2.3 Technology

Technology is improving and starting to understand and be able to manipulate our evolutionary ingrained biochemical behaviors. Those behaviors can also be understood as algorithms, patterns or rules that govern the result i.e. biological response that follows from a particular perception or experience. An example is the arousal level aimed for in participants playing a gambling machine[^7]. In his newest book Noah Harari describes this development:

“_As biotechnology and machine learning improve, it will become easier to manipulate people’s deepest emotions and desires, and it will become more dangerous than ever to just follow your heart. When Coca-Cola, Amazon, Baidu or the government knows how to pull the strings of your heart and press the buttons of your brain, could you still tell the difference between your self and their marketing experts?_”

He concludes with a hint what he says could help to protect us from those dangers:

“_To succeed in such a daunting task, you will need to work very hard on getting to know your operating system better. To know what you are, and what you want from life. This is, of course, the oldest advice in the book: know thyself. For thousands of years philosophers and prophets have urged people to know themselves._” [^8]

Those are the three factors that combining and the lack of our understanding of human psychology that shows the importance of knowing ourselves and our human ingrained tendencies.

### 2.2 The vulnerability of children

Since ages, our society gives much attention to the security and development of its children.

This securing arises out of the physical and cognitive inferiority and leads to potential vulnerability to superior adults. A simple example for the ubiquitousness of this knowledge is telling children not to get into a strangers' car. This psychological vulnerability and susceptibility has led to laws and regulations to protect children for example from violent content carried out in Germany by the organization Unterhaltungssoftware Selbstkontrolle abbreviated as USK[^9].

Therefore, there should also be a mechanism institution or system to protect children of the above-described algorithms and game mechanics.

## 3 Regulation

As one might think the solution for the dangers of the persuasive technologies described above would be to simply regulate those parts of the system (i.e. the gaming industry) to hinder its destructive consequences. But regulating our free market system can also have bad consequences.

An example of those consequences of drug prohibitions is the not taxed black markets that flourish through them. For a current example, one only needs to look at the newest developments in Austria which prohibited the operation of Uber and deprived its citizens of a harmless service they like to use, to secure jobs in the taxi industry. Other bad consequences are the unintended costs that are, in most cases, carried by the consumer in the form of higher prices, fewer available products, services, and opportunities, and stifled wages or job opportunities[^10]. An example of our case could be a shift to even more harmful manipulation, unregulated techniques.

Finally, regulations take a long time to develop and are not suited for the complex information technology sector. A game is a highly complex system that interacts with its users in a highly complex way. A game development company could for example psychologically manipulate millions of people worldwide for years before the government has effectively formulated what exactly needs to be regulated.

Regulation, therefore might not be the right way to protect the consumer in this regard.

## 4 Conclusion

I played around two hours a day of Clash of Clans and other games when I was around 13 years old to when I was around 15 years old, a game where you develop your fortress through producing, attacking and gaining resources from other users. But I was not completely enjoying and emerging myself in the game. I opened the application each hour or so to harvest the scarce resources of my farms and factories. The Game designers used the technique of torture breaks, explained above, to make me come back to the game and develop a habit of playing it.

After learning about the effect and utilization of my psychology my intents I felt betrayed and shifted to more entertaining or educating games and activities.

The danger of psychological manipulation which arises from the accelerating technological developments, the findings in psychology and the adoption of those from the game industry could therefore, effectively be prevented in teaching children in ground-, and secondary schools or through online resources, about the human psychology, its biases and how companies like the ones that create game take advantage of it.
